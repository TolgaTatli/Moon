## Site Setup
A quick checklist of the files you’ll want to edit to get up and running.    

### Site Wide Configuration
`_config.yml` is your friend. Open it up and personalize it. Most variables are self explanatory but here's an explanation of each if needed:

#### title

The title of your site... shocker!

Example `title: My Awesome Site`

#### bio

The description to show on your homepage.

#### description

The description to use for meta tags and navigation menu.

#### url

Used to generate absolute urls in `sitemap.xml`, `feed.xml`, and for generating canonical URLs in `<head>`. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. *Don't include a trailing `/`*.

Examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://taylantatli.me/Moon
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url:
{% endhighlight %}

#### reading_time

Set true to show reading time for posts. And set `words_per_minute`, default is 200.

#### logo
Your site's logo. It will show on homepage and navigation menu. Also used for twitter meta tags.

#### background
Image for background. If you don't set it, color will be used as a background.

#### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Google Analytics UA and Webmaster Tool verification tags can be entered in `_config.yml`. For more information on obtaining these meta tags check [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownership) support.

#### MathJax
It's enabled. But if you don't want to use it. Set it false in  `_config.yml`.

#### Disqus Comments
Set your disqus shortname in `_config.yml` to use comments.

---

### Navigation Links

To set what links appear in the top navigation edit `_data/navigation.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like. *External links will open in a new window.*

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Home
  url: /

- title: Blog
  url: /blog/

- title: Projects
  url: /projects/

- title: About
  url: /about/

- title: Moon
  url: http://taylantatli.me/Moon
{% endhighlight %}

## Layouts and Content

Moon Theme use [Jekyll Compress](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html) to compress html output. But it can cause errors if you use "linenos" (line numbers). I suggest don't use line numbers for codes, because it won't look good with this theme, also i didn't give a proper style for them. If you insist to use line numbers, just remove `layout: compress` string from layouts. It will disable compressing.

### Feature Image

You can set feature image per post. Just add `feature: some link` to your post's front matter.

```
feature: /assets/img/some-image.png
or
feaure: http://example.com/some-image.png
```    
 This also will be used for twitter card:

### Comments
To show disqus comments for your post add `comments: true` to your post's front matter.
