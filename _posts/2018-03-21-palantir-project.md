  <b>Palantir</b>: a magical artifact from J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium.
  It is used both for communication and seeing events in other parts of the world.
  
  "<i>One palantir to rule them all.</i>"
</center>

The <b>Palantir Project</b> is a personal experiment, conducted in partnership
with [Norman Marlier](https://normanmarlier.github.io), whose ultimate objective is to 
develop a modular smart home virtual assistant ecosystem. The system should be able 
in the end to monitor sensors, cameras and other devices to inform its users about 
the status of their home as well as provide means to control certain parts of it, 
like locks and coffee makers for instance.

The project is still in its infancy but should grow in the following months.
If you want to dive right into the technical details, you can follow the project's 
development on the official [Github](https://github.com/flopeters1337/Palantir-project).
